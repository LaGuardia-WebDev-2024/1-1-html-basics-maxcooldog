POEM BILLY
  </h1>
<p>
Best friends are like stars on a cloudy night
 <br>  you may not see them but you know they are always there 
<br> through thick or thin their freindship shines bright
  </p>
<p>
  You both can share times of laughter and the times of sorrow 
<br> and those little secrets shared are safe and kept forever <br>
theres never a doubt each of you will be there come tomorrow
  </p>
<p>
  Even if lifes path changes along the way and one moves away
 <br> distance and time can never change the bond between best friends
 <br> that truly special friendship in each others heart to stay 
  </p>
<p>
  Regards, billy.
